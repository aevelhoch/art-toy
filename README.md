My first react project, an attempt at an art creation toy with purposely limited tools.

## Completed

- All basic art tools
- Ease of use features
- Undo/Redo
- Save/Load (copyable text string)

## To-Do

- Zoom/Render size
- Hold click to color on mouseover
- Fun stats
- Nicer UI

## Possibly In The Future

- save to web gallery
- view web gallery

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
