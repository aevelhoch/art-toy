My first react project, an attempt at an art creation toy with purposely limited tools.

## Completed

- All basic art tools
- Ease of use features
- Undo/Redo

## To-Do

- Save/Load (to file or copyable text string)
- Zoom/Render size
- Hold click to color on mouseover
- Fun stats
- Nicer UI
- Help/How-to page

## Possibly In The Future

- save to web gallery
- view web gallery

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
